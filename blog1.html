    <h3 class="section-title">When Machines Start Thinking Like Us</h3>
    <p class="bio">
      Artificial intelligence is changing the way we study, work, and even think. It can write essays, generate art, solve complex problems, and respond faster than most humans ever could. It’s efficient, impressive, and sometimes a little unsettling. And yes, an AI produced that. That’s kind of the point.When machines start sounding, thinking, and behaving like humans. How much control are we truly willing to give up?

    <h3 class="section-title">The Problem</h3>
    <p class="bio">
      AI technology has evolved from a simple grammar corrector to a virtual human-like chatbot and even a simulation of a human. It wasn't much of a problem back then since it was only used when absolutely necessary, but when it isn't, it becomes a problem. The abusive and unnecessary use of AI is what will lead to a catastrophe. I am not saying people should stop using AI for good, but instead we should be more cautious. The extensive use of AI is harming society. From my own experience, I’ve noticed how AI is often used to create silly or meaningless videos online. At first, these videos were funny and harmless; however, the more people discovered how easy it was to generate them, the more they were used inappropriately and carelessly. What many users fail to realize is that AI consumes real resources, such as water and energy, just to function. Using AI for unnecessary content may seem insignificant, but when done repeatedly by millions of people, the impact becomes much more serious.

    <h3 class="section-title">AI as a Tool, Not a Toy</h3>
    <p class="bio">
      AI should be treated as a tool rather than a form of entertainment used without limits. While AI can be helpful and innovative, extensive use of AI is harming society. From my own experience, I’ve noticed how AI is often used to create silly or meaningless videos online. What many users fail to realize is that AI consumes real resources, such as water and energy, just to function. Using AI for unnecessary content may seem insignificant, but when done repeatedly by millions of people, the impact becomes much more serious. Be wise and use AI responsibly.
