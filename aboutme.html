        If you had told me at 13 where I would be today, I might have found it hard to believe.<sup>1</sup>
        Growing up, life was often confusing and didn't look like the usual story I imagined.<sup>2</sup>
        I've always tried to stay happy, even when things felt uncertain.<sup>3</sup>
        Most of the time, I lived at my father's house, but it was really my grandparents who helped raise me.<sup>4</sup>
        At first, this unusual family setup was hard to accept, especially when I saw friends with more typical families.<sup>5</sup>
        My parents weren't married, and my mom visited sometimes, so I also spent time at her place, where my other grandmother lives.<sup>6</sup>
        Even though my family was different from others, it was still full of love in its own special way.<sup>7</sup>
        My grandmother taught me early how to be independent, which wasn't always easy because sometimes I felt like I had no one to fully rely on.<sup>8</sup>
        But that independence became a strong part of me.<sup>9</sup>
      </p>
      <img src="images/bio/pic2.jpeg" alt="Childhood Photo 2" class="img-right" style="width:220px; height:220px;">
      <p>
        Over time, I started to understand why my life had been like this, and even though it wasn't simple, it taught me important lessons about staying strong.<sup>10</sup>
        I learned that staying positive, even when things look different or hard, really helps.<sup>11</sup>
        These experiences shaped me and helped me see the love and care around me, even if it wasn't like what most people expect.<sup>12</sup>
        They gave me the confidence to keep going, believing that better things are still coming.<sup>13</sup>
        Life's challenges and my unusual family made me who I am today.<sup>14</sup>
        I'm thankful for the strength and hope those times gave me, and I carry those feelings as I face each new day with optimism.<sup>15</sup>

      <p>
        My teenage years were a mix of trying to figure out who I really wanted to be and dealing with the challenges of growing up.<sup>1</sup>
        Looking back, there are moments that make me cringe, times when I felt awkward like many teenagers do.<sup>2</sup>
        Even though those times were uncomfortable, they were important for me to learn and grow.<sup>3</sup>
        Like many teens, I spent a lot of time trying hard to fit in and be seen as cool.<sup>4</sup>
        I followed trends, wanted to be liked, and sometimes forgot who I really was.<sup>5</sup>
        But after a while, I got tired of pretending to be someone I wasn't.<sup>6</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Things changed during the pandemic when I turned 15 and was stuck at home with a lot of free time.<sup>7</sup>
        Instead of feeling lonely, I used that quiet time to slow down and think about myself and what was important.<sup>8</sup>
        Without all the usual distractions of school and friends, I had space to think deeply about my choices and how to be better.<sup>9</sup>
        I started learning new things from inside myself, thinking about how I could improve.<sup>10</sup>
      </p>
      <img src="images/bio/teen2.jpg" alt="Teenage Photo 2" class="img-left" style="width:40%; height:200px;">
      <p>
        That still, quiet time became a big turning point for me.<sup>11</sup>
        It helped me become stronger and more confident.<sup>12</sup>
        It was a key time that helped build the person I am now and gave me the drive to keep moving forward.<sup>13</sup>
        The self-awareness I gained helped me accept who I am instead of hiding parts of myself.<sup>14</sup>
        I started paying more attention to what I really like and who I want to be, instead of just trying to fit in.<sup>15</sup>
        This didn't happen all at once, but step by step.<sup>16</sup>
        I learned that growing is something we do all the time, and every experience, good or bad, helps us become stronger.<sup>17</sup>
        Overall, my teenage years gave me a strong base for a lifelong journey of learning and accepting myself.<sup>18</sup>

      <p>
        College has been an exciting and important part of my life so far.<sup>1</sup>
        It's a time when I keep growing while staying connected to who I was as a teenager.<sup>2</sup>
        Many of my values stay the same, but I've also learned to accept change and adjust in new ways.<sup>3</sup>
        Every experience, whether it's hard or successful, gives me a chance to think and get better.<sup>4</sup>
        I still make mistakes, but now I try to be patient and kind to myself about them.<sup>5</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        College has pushed me to leave my comfort zone, meet people from many different backgrounds, and understand myself better.<sup>6</sup>
        Meeting new people has helped me see the world in new ways.<sup>7</sup>
        This part of life has also encouraged me to keep working toward being a better version of myself every day.<sup>8</sup>
        What started as a quiet time of thinking during the pandemic has grown into a constant process of learning and growing.<sup>9</sup>
        I'm filled with hope and strength, and I believe that no matter where life takes me, I have what I need to face it with confidence and kindness.<sup>10</sup>
      </p>
      <img src="images/bio/college2.jpeg" alt="College Photo 2" class="img-right" style="width:45%; height:250px;">
      <p>
        College is about more than just school; it's about learning life lessons and building my future.<sup>11</sup>
        I'm thankful for the chance to follow my interests and challenge myself.<sup>12</sup>
        This time has made me more committed to always growing and learning.<sup>13</sup>
        While I respect my past and what shaped me, I also look forward to what's next with excitement.<sup>14</sup>
        The journey continues, and I'm ready to face whatever comes with an open heart and mind.<sup>15</sup>
