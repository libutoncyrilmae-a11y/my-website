        I used to genuinely love programming, spending hours learning and dreaming of my future. I loved the thought of developing into a proficient programmer who could produce and comprehend more with each line of code. I still like programming, but not as much as I used to. I'm not sure whether this is the career path I want to take, but I'm still optimistic that as long as I keep learning and developing, the passion will eventually come back knowing that it used to be my dream. That was my dream. Well, it used to be.
      </p>

      <p>
        I first discovered my love for programming back in high school when I learned about HTML, robotics, and Arduino. Those early experiences sparked a curiosity in me, and I found myself experimenting with code and gadgets just for the joy of it. That excitement eventually led me to pursue the ICT strand in senior high school, where I could explore technology more deeply. But even then, a small voice of uncertainty started creeping in. I brushed it off because a big part of me still genuinely enjoyed programming, and I told myself I could figure it out along the way.
      </p>

        Everything shifted during my first year of college, when I was introduced to C++ and Java. I completely fumbled, which felt strange since I had coded with Java back in high school. Stepping into college made me realize that I didn’t feel entirely at home in this course. I knew I could keep learning, but my passion was fading, and that realization hit harder than I expected. Now, in my second year, that dream I once held so tightly feels like it’s slowly slipping away, and I’ve started to accept that I might not chase it as fiercely as before.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even so, I’m still hopeful. I’m learning to take things one day at a time, improving myself, and holding onto my very last spark, my passion for HTML and CSS, which I hope never fades. I want to finish what I’ve started, and after this course, I plan to explore other fields, continue learning new things, and maybe uncover a skill I didn’t know I had. I try to trust that it’s never too late to discover new potential, and I hold onto the hope that, little by little, I might regain the spark that once made me fall in love with programming.
